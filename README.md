  ## Description 

  > In this web based application a burger logger is created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a custom ORM. Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app which performs the following function :
  

  *  It lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat

  *  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

  * Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
